  - at the beginning means im currently workin on it

Text
	Manage old text and remove it?
	Make a dynamic fps/object/draw call counter (like crysis)
Lights
	Experiment with the lightloop with entities attaching lights to themselves, not lights attaching to entities
	Experiment with optimizing static lights (no need to lightloop them)
	-Global lights (rendered as FSquad/alltiles no matter what). For sun or whatever.
	-Maybe put into quadtree (more info in entities section)

	Lights need to do non-hackey way of getting matricies
	Lights need to have attachments be offsets
	non hackey sphere thing
Console
	get it rendering text with the renderqueue system
	make it not shitty
World
	Use a queue system to figure out of tree leafs need bbox recalculation
	Implement BBOX smallerizing
	-Disable depth testing to see weather or not my little ordering method helps
		-attempted, not enough of a change to tell
	Basic AABB->AABB collision detection
	Basic SPHERE->AABB collision detection
Deferred
	fix tiled deferred lighting?
	-finish directional light shading
	PBR support
Forward
	add forward pipeline
Entities
	change quadtree check algorithm to add all entities if the entire quadtree bbox checks out, dont bother checking ent bboxes
		maybe
Gamecode
	-Finish Figuring it out
States
	have states track framebuffers, different masks, and do a glclear thing
Tiled Deferred
	-fix pixeldepth->viewpos method
	optimize tiled deferred render
		screen quadtree method
		frustums
		Sphere projection method
Models
	Add basic sphere models (of multiple types... icosphere, normalized tesselated cube, etc)
	Be able to generate lower LOD meshes
Animations
	Figure it out
Textures
	Experiment with packing whole texturegroups into one texturearray
		most textures in a texturegroup are gonna be same size anyway
		 or experiment with packing texturegroups of the same size into texture arrays
	Add basic procedural texture functions
	Add basic texture manipulation functions (mirror, scale, invert, combine, etc)
Multithread
	Figure it out
	A ways down the road
Terrain
	do it shittily
	then add physics or someshit
	then do it betterly
	then make editorly
	then make reactive?
List stuff
	memsetting on delete may be redundant. possibly remove it
Misc
	-Mass Code cleanup
Renderqueue
	-add many buffers that can be "triggered" for update
		may be part of the VAO manager, add a "trigger" flag and a method for renderqueue to keep track of that
	-add many more UBOs that can be bound an unbound, trigger updates, etc
