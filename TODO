Text
	Manage old text and remove it
Lights
	Non point lights
	Experiment with the lightloop with entities attaching lights to themselves, not lights attaching to entities
	Global lights (rendered as FSquad/alltiles no matter what)
Console
	get it rendering text better
World
	Disable depth testing to see weather or not my little ordering method helps
Deferred
	add tiled defferred lighting
	finish directional light shading
Forward
	add forward pipeline
Entities
	Add into a SEPERATE quadtree
	walk all quadtrees together, only deviate when paths diverge
	change quadtree check algorithm to add all entities if the entire quadtree bbox checks out, dont bother checking ent bboxes
		-maybe
Gamecode
	Figure it out
