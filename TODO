Text
	Manage old text and remove it
	Implement a glyph based system (alternative to sentance based system, for fast changing small stuff like fps counter)
	Make a dynamic fps/object/draw call counter (like crysis)
Lights
	Non point lights
	Experiment with the lightloop with entities attaching lights to themselves, not lights attaching to entities
	Experiment with optimizing static lights (no need to lightloop them)
	Global lights (rendered as FSquad/alltiles no matter what). For sun or whatever.
	Maybe put into quadtree (more info in entities section)
Console
	get it rendering text better
	get it rendering text with the renderqueue system
	make it not shitty
World
	Disable depth testing to see weather or not my little ordering method helps
		-attempted, not enough of a change to tell
Deferred
	add tiled defferred lighting (see tiled deferred section)
	finish directional light shading
Forward
	add forward pipeline
Entities
	Add into a SEPERATE quadtree... or maybe the same
		the world quadtree would have a bitmask for stuff in each leaf/children leafs. Just AND the bitmask as you walk up the quadtree.
	walk all quadtrees together, only deviate when paths diverge
	change quadtree check algorithm to add all entities if the entire quadtree bbox checks out, dont bother checking ent bboxes
		-maybe
Gamecode
	Figure it out
States
	have states track framebuffers, different masks, and do a glclear thing
Tiled Deferred
	Implement a basic tiled deferred render
	optimize tiled deferred render
		screen quadtree method
		frustums
		Sphere projection method
Models
	Add basic sphere models
Animations
	Figure it out
Textures
	Experiment with packing whole texturegroups into one texturearray
		-most textures in a texturegroup are gonna be same size anyway
	Add basic procedural texture functions
	Add basic texture manipulation functions (mirror, scale, invert, combine, etc)
Multithread
	Figure it out
	A ways down the road
