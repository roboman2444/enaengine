Text-
	Manage old text and remove it
Renderbatch
	Renderbatch with flags (transparency, blending, depth test, depth mask, etc)
		- state flags in glmanager for less switching around
	Generic "shove vertex and indice data here" renderbatch
	Generic "shove VAO here" renderbatch
Lights
	Non point lights
	Experiment with the lightloop with entities attaching lights to themselves, not lights attaching to entities
	Global lights (rendered as FSquad no matter what)
Console
	get it rendering text better
World
	Disable depth testing to see weather or not my little ordering method helps
